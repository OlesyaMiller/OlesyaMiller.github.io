I discovered my love for coding during my last year at Hunter College in New York. After graduation I decided to teach myself HTML and CSS and even built a couple of static websites. But I never ended up getting a stable full-time job and went back to working as a bartender. That’s when I realized CSS and HTML would not take me very far and that I had to learn real programming. 

I chose software engineering because I think it’s one of the greatest fields out there with unlimited opportunities for growth. It’s one of the high-paying professions of the future. As opposed to the common misconception about programming as a dull and purely technical discipline accessible to very few brilliant minds, I actually find it very creative and learnable as long as you have patience and determination. Just think about all the different ways of solving the same problem in code! Pure creativity!

I decided to become a software engineer because I want to do meaningful and fulfilling work, and may be inspire others one day. I like solving problems and build stuff.
And I like the life-long learning aspect of it.

I also chose software engineering because I think it’s a perfect job for an introvert. As a bartender I have been fired for not smiling enough (don’t get me wrong, I still smile, I just don’t like being forced to do that) 

So here I am, a student of Flatiron School. Let’s see where this journey takes me!
